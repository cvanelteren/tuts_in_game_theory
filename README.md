Learning how to do rust and game theory in one full swoop


This repository contains a kinetic (mechanistic) try-out code to encode a simple 2 player game in rust.

## Getting Started

`main.rs` contains a simple implementation of a 2 player game where each player can choose between two strategies: Cooperate or Defect. The game is played for a fixed number of rounds, and the players' scores are calculated based on their choices.

It will generate a bunch of outcome results in `data` that can be plotted with `analysis.py`.
